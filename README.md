# Google Search - Project 0
### Harvard CS50

This project is a recreation of the google search engine page along with the advanced search and image search options. All the input boxes used in the project are functional and use googles search engine to search for a specific query.

The styling is designed to closely resemble: google.com, as of November 2020. All the styling is bespoke/custom CSS3.

This project uses the flex and grid elements to achieve a responsive and more accurate design. Also, with '@media' queries this provides more control over the page elements.

All pages have responsive meta tags and are therefore responsive.
